    "* Problem situation and context: Overhead lines have to be flown over at a certain rhythm and inspected for damage. The documentation of the inspection results is complex. For example, when flying over overhead lines, two fitters must fly along with the pilot. The two fitters check the components, with one of the two fitters also taking on the documentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "User story: As a fitter, I want to keep the effort involved in documenting inspections as low as possible while maintaining high quality. If, for example, both fitters carry out the visual inspections and the documentation is automated, the quality can be increased with less time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible solutions and ideas (if available, including example startups):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  “speech to text”. When inspecting overhead lines, the fitters speak the damage reports live into a microphone. The necessary systems are filled via voice input (\"FM Check\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "The fitters have around 20-30 seconds to inspect each pylon.\n",
    "The overhead line survey is only a \"proof of concept\". There are other use cases where \"speech to text\" supports the technicians. When climbing pylons, for example, the fitters enter the results after climbing the pylon. With speech to text, the documentation can be done live and work safety is still guaranteed because the fitters have both hands free.\n",
